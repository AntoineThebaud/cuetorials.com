title: "Query Syntax"
---

It is desirable to be able to query CUE values.
Querying, in this context, is more than just retrieving data.
It also means the selection of nodes to which to apply constraints,
like an advanced form of pattern constraints,
as well as for the interpretation of lists as associative lists.

See the [CUE Querying extension](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/165)
proposal for more details.
Note, there are several elements of this proposal
which have already been added to the language.
