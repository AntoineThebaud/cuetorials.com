When you start out with Cue, the systax may feel overwhelming
and the processing complex or disorienting.
That's why Cuetorials is here to help you get started and discover the joy of Cue.

Our experience in the Cue community and working with companies
has lead to some easy paths to learning Cue, largely around configuration.
The following sections will show you how to:

1. Validate config files and data
2. Generate configuration and more
3. Work with modules and packages
4. Write scripts with Cue

Before we get to that, let's start with some very simple Cue code and commands.
