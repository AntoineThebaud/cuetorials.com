- CUE stands for `configure, unify, execute`.
- Cue is a `logical language`. Say what you want to be true rather than how to do a thing.
- Cue uses `unification` to validate your code, determining if it is consistant and valid.
- Cue is `turing incomplete` where you cannot program in the traditional sense.
- While you cannot program, you can do `stateful` things in the scripting system.
